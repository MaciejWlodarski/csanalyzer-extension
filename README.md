# CSAnalyzer Extension

CSAnalyzer Extension allows you to upload FACEIT match demos directly to CSAnalyzer with just one click.

This makes the analysis process faster, smoother, and much more convenient: no switching tabs, no copying match IDs, and no manual uploads.

With CSAnalyzer Extension, analyzing your FACEIT matches becomes seamless and effortless.
